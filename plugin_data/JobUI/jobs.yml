# NOTES FOR CHANGING THE UI DETAILS: (Button-Name & Image-Type & Image)
# Use "§" and "0-9" or "a-f" and "r" after it to add a color. E.g. "§6This text will be Orange"
# Use "\n" to go to the next line. E.g. "First Line\nSecond Line"
# Image Types: 0 (Path like "textures/blocks/coal_ore") and 1 (URL like "https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/minecraft_gamepedia/c/c5/Oak_Log_Axis_Y_JE5_BE3.png")
# URL Image Type starts with "https://"
# If you don't want an image for the button, put the Image Type to: -1
