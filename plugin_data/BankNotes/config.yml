#Advanced settings
##These are some advanced settings. Only change them if you know what you're doing

# If you want to reset the economy, change the economyid to anything you like (won't be seen by players). Notes that have a different economyid won't work.
# This way you don't have to delete everyones banknotes if you want to reset everyones money.
economyid: "economyid"

# By enabling this, notes that don't have an economyid (notes from v1.1.0) will still work.
# If you change the econid it might be a good idea to disable this too.
